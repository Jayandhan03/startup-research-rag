 🧠 HR Policy Q&A Assistant (RAG-powered)

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that intelligently answers employee HR policy questions using PDF documents. Built with LangChain and Qdrant, the assistant retrieves, reranks, and generates accurate answers from company policy files.

## ✅ Features

- 📥 **Incremental PDF ingestion**
- ✂️ **Semantic chunking + embedding**
- 🧠 **Multi-index vector store (Flat, HNSW, IVF) using Qdrant**
- ⚖️ **BM25/MMR-based reranking for relevance**
- 💬 **LLM-based direct answer generation**
- 🧾 **DOCX rendering of answers**
- 🧠 **Prompt templating support**
- 📡 **LangSmith integration**
- 🧠 **Multi-turn memory (WIP)**
- 🌐 **Streamlit interface (planned)**
- 🐳 **Dockerized deployment (in progress)**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Ingest HR PDFs and split them into semantically meaningful chunks
2. Embed the chunks using OpenAI or HuggingFace models
3. Store them in Qdrant with efficient vector indexing
4. Retrieve top-k documents using similarity search
5. Rerank results using BM25 or MMR
6. Use LLM with templated prompt to generate final response
7. Export response to DOCX

## 🔍 Sample Output

**Q:** "How many casual leaves do employees get per year?"
**A:** "Yes, your legal spouse is eligible for coverage under our medical, dental, and vision plans. You will need to provide documentation to verify their eligibility."
